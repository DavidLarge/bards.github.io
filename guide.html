<p><font size="+2"><b>TUTORIAL 1: Borrow, Adapt, Re-mix: Digital Shakespeare (BARDS)</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+2"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
<p>
Between 1603 and 1623, there were three different editions of Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet</i> published: Q1 (the first quarto) in 1603; Q2 (the second quarto) in 1604-5; and F1 (the text that appeared in the first folio, the first collection of all of Shakespeare’s plays) in 1623.</p>
<p>
Q1 is the shortest at just over 2200 lines; Q2 and F1 are almost twice the length of Q1. All three have material unique to themselves. They also have shared material, but at times in unique order. Further, all three omit material that the other two contain. An editor’s challenge—your challenge—is to examine any <b><i>part</i></b> of the first scene of <i>Hamlet</i> in these three editions and make one edition that you feel best represents that portion of the scene.</p>
<p>
<i>Editing</i> Q1, Q2, and F1 provides a fuller sense of <i>Hamlet</i> as text, but perhaps only a partial picture of <i>Hamlet</i> as drama. Plays were primarily played (rather than sold as books), so any editor’s challenge is to imagine how the words on the page might manifest themselves as actions on a stage. To help you in this respect, the BARDS web interface (available in your tutorials—<b>please bring a laptop if you have one</b>) provides images from four graphic novels—with their words removed—so that you can overlay your edited text onto images. That is, you’ll need to imagine how the words on the page might appear as actions in a theatre (either a real theatre or the theatre of the mind).</p>
<p>
<font size="+2"><b>Aims:</b></font></p>
<p><l>
<li>To improve your skills in close reading texts</li>
<li>To editorially construct a text from multiple texts</li>
<li>To envision dramatic text as dramatic action</li>
<li>To adapt and gain insight into the process of adaptation</li>
<li>To understand how early modern English differs from today's standard written English</li><l></p>
<p>
<font size="+2"><b>Preparation:</b></font></p>
<p><l>
<li>Read Act 1, Scene 1 of <i>Hamlet</i>. Pick one portion of that scene that you would like to adapt, represent, or explore in more detail.</li>
<li>Look at the few pages from Dunn, No Fear, Sexton, and Classics on eReserve so that you will be familiar with the images available to you.</li></p>
<p>
<font size="+2"><b>Tutorial Tasks:</b></font></p>
<p><ol>
<li><b>EDIT: select, omit, or alter any portion of <i>Hamlet</i> 1.1. on a phrase-by-phrase basis.</b> BARDS will juxtapose similar phrases from Q1, Q2, and F1. Decide which of the available phrases you prefer for your portion of 1.1. (if any). If none of the phrases from Q1, Q2, or F1 suffices, you may leave the phrase out of your edition or type one of your own. Should you choose to type your own phrase, that phrase might correct the other options for punctuation, spelling, and the like (i.e. editing) or it could be your own words entirely (i.e. adapting).</li></p>
<p><li><b>ADAPT: select (or don’t select—it’s up to you) an image to represent visually your textual choice.</b> You can choose from four sets of images (graphic novels by Classics, Dunn, No Fear, or Sexton)—mixing, matching, or re-ordering the images as you like. You can overlay your text into the word balloons on the images (or anywhere on or beside the images; please note that the text does not automatically auto-fit the balloons). If you would like more balloons on an image, you can add them too. You may use any image that you would like as many times as you would like and add as much or as little as you’d like.</li></p>
<p>
<li><b>CREATE</b>: create at least a one- or two-page spread. Save and print that spread for your assignment.</li></ol></p>
<p>
<font size="+2"><b>BARDS User’s Guide:</b></font></p>
<p>
<b>Selecting</b> an image/text: <b>single left click</b> will make an image/text appear on the canvas; whichever image/text you click will come forward on the canvas (i.e. in front of other images/text)</p>
<p>
<b>Moving</b> an image/text on the canvas: <b>click and drag</b></p>
<p>
<b>Increasing the size</b> of an image/text: “<b>1</b>” key</p>
<p>
<b>Decreasing the size</b> of an image/text: “<b>2</b>” key</p>
<p>
<b>Flip</b> an image/text <b>horizontally</b>: “<b>3</b>” key</p>
<p>
<b>Flip</b> an image/text <b>vertically</b>: “<b>4</b>” key</p>
<p>
<b>Delete the current</b> image/text: “<b>5</b>” key</p>
<p>
<b>Rotate</b> an image/text <b>clockwise</b>: “<b>6</b>” key</p>
<p>
<b>Rotate</b> an image/text <b>counter-clockwise</b>: “<b>7</b>” key</p>
<p>(Note that you should resize your image before rotating it; a known issue/bug causes some cropping on large images when rotated. We're working on it.)</p>
<p>
<b>Save</b>: press the <b>save link</b> at the top. A new tab will open with the image. From the File menu in your browser, select “Save Page As”: a dialogue box will open. In that dialogue box, name your file and select a location for saving (e.g. on your shared drive or on a USB). <b>Please note that this function takes a picture of your canvas; it <u><i>does not</u></i> save the canvas for later editing.</b></p>
<p>
<font size="+2"><b>ASSIGNMENT (worth 5% of your total grade):</b></font></p>
<p>
Submit your one- or two-page spread from BARDS and a separate 500-word written reflection in <b>both electronic</b> (on Blackboard) and <b>paper</b> (at the English Department) formats. Your written reflection might respond to some of the following questions (remember that you have only 500 words):</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Has this exercise changed your idea of close reading? Has it helped you to read a dramatic text closely? How?</li></p>
<p>
<li>How has this exercise changed your ideas of what comprises a critical edition of a text? What have you learned about the editing process? What were the biggest obstacles for selecting or editing a phrase? How did you overcome these obstacles?</li></p>
<p>
<li>How does your adaptation fit with Hutcheon’s idea that “Adaptation is repetition, but repetition without replication” (7)? What changes have you made and why?</li></p>
<p>
<li>From this exercise, did you learn anything about early-modern textual practices (e.g. spelling, language, fluidity of text, etc.)? If so, what did you learn and what stimulated this learning? How does early modern English differ from today’s English?</li></p>
<p>
<li>How did this exercise enrich your understanding of this scene in <i>Hamlet</i> (or <i>Hamlet</i> as a whole)? What new insights did you gain and how did you gain them?</li></p>
